# Restaurant Management System
## Overview

The Restaurant Management System is a Java-based application designed to streamline the operations of a restaurant. It allows users to manage menus, place orders, track customers, and generate reports. The system uses MySQL for data storage and Java Swing with WindowBuilder for the graphical user interface (GUI).

This project demonstrates the use of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, recursive methods , control structures , and database connectivity in Java. It also includes a login form for user authentication and ensures modularity by using multiple Java classes.
